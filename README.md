SString (Struct String)
=======================

SString is a string library that introduces a new structure SString, that works like a string.

----------

The structure consists of:
  1. The string itself, which is a C string, so normal C string functions can use it.
  2. Length, which is the length of actual characters in the string. It doesn't include \0 or  characters behind it. 
  3. Size, which is the size of the allocated memory for the string.
